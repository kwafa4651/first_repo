    <b>information abuot computer</b>
<br>
<p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to automatically carry out sequences <br>
   of arithmetic or logical operations (computation). Modern digital electronic computers can <br>

    perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers to <br>
     perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete <br>
      computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment <br>
       needed and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function <br>
        together, such as a computer network or computer cluster
