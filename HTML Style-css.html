<h5>what is css </h5>
<blockquote>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is used to format the layout of a webpage.

    With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing between 
    elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background images or background 
    colors are to be used, different displays for different devices and screen sizes, and much more!

 <b>Using CSS</b>
<li>Inline - by using the <span> &lt; style &gt;</span> attribute inside HTML elements</li>
<li>Internal - by using a  <span> &lt;style &gt;</span> element in the <span>&lt;head &gt;</span>  section</li>
<li>    External - by using a <span>&lt; link &gt;</span> element to link to an external CSS file

The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.


However, in this tutorial we will use inline and internal styles, because 
this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try it yourself.

 <b>Inline CSS</b>
<p>An inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

    An inline CSS uses the <span> style </span> attribute of an HTML element.
    
    The following example sets the text color of the <span>&lt; h1 &gt;</span> element to blue,
         and the text color of the <span>&lt; p &gt;</span> element to red:</p>

<b>Internal CSS</b>
<p>An internal CSS is used to define a style for a single HTML page
    An internal CSS is defined in the <span>&lt; head &gt;</span> section of an HTML page, within a <span>&lt; style &gt;</span>
    The following example sets the text color of ALL the <span>&lt; h1  &gt;</span> elements (on that page) to blue, and the text color of ALL the <span>&lt;p &gt;</span> elements to red. In addition, the page will be displayed with a "powderblue" background color:

<b>External CSS</b>
<p>An external style sheet is used to define the style for many HTML pages.

    To use an external style sheet, add a link to it in the <span>&lt; head &gt;</span> section of each HTML page:</p>
